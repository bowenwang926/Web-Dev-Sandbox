# Web-Dev-Sandbox
Some work remains unfinished, was not able to implementing components without dunking a very large margin of time. Ran into a lot of problems trying to populate a map within a map using setStates, overall UI is completed, most functionalities are in place. Was able to learn a lot from this project!

Future work to be done:
1. nesting components where my created divs and buttons are stored in maps is definitely do-able, that would be the immediate next step.
2. refactoring some of the code to make it more sustainable for changes
3. improve UI design
